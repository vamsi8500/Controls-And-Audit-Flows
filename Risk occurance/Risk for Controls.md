# SOX ITGC Controls and Risks

## 1. Access Provisioning
- **Control**: Grant users access based on their job role and responsibilities.
- **Risk**: If access is granted incorrectly, unauthorized people might access sensitive data or systems.

## 2. Access Deprovisioning
- **Control**: Remove user access when it’s no longer needed (e.g., when someone leaves or changes roles).
- **Risk**: Failing to remove access can allow former employees to misuse data or systems.

## 3. Authentication
- **Control**: Use strong methods (like multi-factor authentication) to verify users before granting access.
- **Risk**: Weak authentication can let unauthorized users access systems, leading to data breaches or fraud.

## 4. User Access Review
- **Control**: Regularly check if users still need their access based on their roles.
- **Risk**: If access isn’t reviewed, users might keep unnecessary access, increasing the risk of misuse.

## 5. Change Management
- **Control**: Ensure all system changes are properly documented, approved, and tested before being made.
- **Risk**: Unapproved or untested changes could cause errors or security problems, leading to financial reporting issues.

## 6. Change Management SOD (Segregation of Duties)
- **Control**: Ensure different people approve and make changes to systems to avoid conflicts of interest.
- **Risk**: If one person controls both approval and implementation, they could make unauthorized changes, causing fraud or errors.

## 7. Backup
- **Control**: Regularly back up important data to ensure it can be recovered if something goes wrong.
- **Risk**: Without proper backups, data could be lost, causing operational and financial issues.
