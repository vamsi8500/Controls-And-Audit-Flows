# ‚úÖ Real-Time Use of Controls & How They Secure Data

## üåê 1. SaaS (Software as a Service)

**Customer Responsibility:** User access, data input/output, basic configurations, audit reviews  
**Examples:** Salesforce, Google Workspace, Office 365

|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) | You enable MFA on Office 365 accounts                         | Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts even if passwords are stolen |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | In Salesforce, only HR users can access employee data         | Limits exposure of sensitive data to only authorized roles            |
| Encryption at Rest and Transit   | Google Workspace encrypts docs stored in Drive (AES-256) and uses HTTPS for transit | Protects data from being read during transmission or storage compromise |
| Activity Logs / Audit Trails     | Admins review login anomalies on the SaaS admin console       | Detects account misuse, enables incident response                     |
| Vendor Certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001) | You verify the provider complies with data security standards | Ensures they follow security best practices for storing your data     |
