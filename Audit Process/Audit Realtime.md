# Audit Process in Real-Time Scenario

### 1. Define the Audit Scope
In this scenario, you're tasked with auditing the security of a company's IT systems to ensure that they meet regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR). You’ll need to determine which parts of the IT environment will be audited. For example:

- Are you auditing access control measures on servers?
- Is the audit only focused on the company’s internal networks?
- Do you need to include cloud services and third-party vendors?

In a real-time setting, the project manager will clarify the areas you need to focus on, like evaluating server configurations, security protocols, and employee access.

**Example Action:**  
After speaking with the client, you decide that the audit will cover the company's network security, access controls for sensitive data, and how they’re complying with GDPR. You also agree on a 3-week timeline.

---

### 2. Set Clear Audit Objectives
The next step is to establish what exactly you want to achieve with the audit. For instance, you might want to:

- Assess compliance with specific regulations (GDPR in this case).
- Ensure internal security controls (like firewalls, encryption) are in place.
- Identify any security vulnerabilities in the network infrastructure.

**Example Action:**  
You and the team decide the audit should confirm whether data is being encrypted when transferred and whether employees are following secure access procedures (like strong password protocols).

---

### 3. Plan the Audit
Once the scope and objectives are clear, you start creating an audit plan. Here, you'll identify:

- **Resources Needed**: Who will help with the audit? What tools (software for vulnerability scanning, documentation templates) will you use?
- **Schedule**: Set clear dates for when to conduct interviews, review documents, and test systems.
- **Audit Criteria**: Define what constitutes compliance and non-compliance. For example, if you're checking for encryption, the standard is that all sensitive data must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

**Example Action:**  
You set a schedule to review security policies in the first week, interview the IT security team on the second, and run tests on security controls on the third week. You also set criteria for compliance with GDPR and data protection laws.

---

### 4. Collect Evidence
Now, you start gathering evidence. In a real-time audit:

- You might review system logs to check if there have been any unauthorized access attempts.
- You’ll interview key employees to confirm they understand security policies.
- You’ll check for compliance with password policies by reviewing whether users follow guidelines.

**Example Action:**  
You go through the company’s server logs and find some instances of failed login attempts. You interview IT staff and discover that the password policies haven’t been updated in months.

---

### 5. Analyze the Data
After collecting evidence, you analyze the data to identify whether security measures are effective. For example:

- Are employees following password policies?
- Are security patches regularly applied to the network?
- Are there any glaring vulnerabilities that expose the company to cyber threats?

**Example Action:**  
You notice that while there is some access control, several users still have access to sensitive data when they no longer need it for their roles. Additionally, some systems are missing critical security updates.

---

### 6. Identify Findings and Non-Conformities
Now you document your findings. These are the issues you found that don’t align with security best practices or regulations. You’ll note the impact of each issue and how serious it is.

**Example Action:**  
You document that:
- **Finding 1**: Inadequate password policies (no two-factor authentication).
- **Finding 2**: Outdated encryption protocols on some servers.
- **Finding 3**: Access control lists not updated to restrict data access for former employees.

---

### 7. Develop Recommendations
With the findings in place, you’ll suggest actionable recommendations for each issue. These might involve:

- Strengthening the password policy (e.g., enforcing two-factor authentication).
- Updating encryption protocols.
- Revoking access for employees who no longer require it.

**Example Action:**  
You propose:
- **Corrective Action**: Implement multi-factor authentication for all users with access to sensitive data.
- **Preventive Action**: Schedule regular reviews of employee access rights to ensure that only authorized individuals can access sensitive information.

---

### 8. Draft the Audit Report
Once you’ve gathered findings and recommendations, you’ll write a report summarizing everything. The report will typically include:
- **Executive Summary**: A brief overview of the audit, the key findings, and their impact.
- **Detailed Findings**: In-depth details on the issues found and their implications.
- **Recommendations**: How to address the identified issues.
- **Conclusion**: A final assessment of the overall security posture.

**Example Action:**  
You complete a report that outlines the weaknesses in the current security system, along with recommendations for improving controls. You highlight areas where the company is compliant and areas that need urgent improvement.

---

### 9. Present the Findings
Finally, you’ll present the findings to management. This could be in a meeting where you walk them through:
- The main issues you found (e.g., outdated encryption protocols, lack of MFA).
- The risks those issues pose to the company (e.g., potential data breaches, regulatory non-compliance).
- The steps they should take to fix the issues.

**Example Action:**  
You meet with the client’s management team and present your audit results. You explain how outdated encryption could lead to data breaches and regulatory fines and suggest implementing the recommended changes.

---

### Ongoing Monitoring and Follow-up
After the audit is complete, you’ll also want to monitor progress and follow up to ensure that the recommended actions are being taken. You might schedule a follow-up audit or a review in 6 months to see if the changes have been implemented.

**Example Action:**  
You set up a follow-up meeting in 6 months to check on the progress of implementing the recommendations and ensure the company is on track to improving security.

---

This is how the audit process would unfold in a real-time scenario. It’s about identifying risks, finding ways to mitigate them, and providing actionable recommendations to improve the organization's security posture.
