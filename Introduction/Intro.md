**Risk Management Professional | IT Risk & Compliance | Audit & Assurance**  

Over the past three years, Iâ€™ve been deeply involved in IT risk management, security compliance, and audit processes. My role has always been about more than just checking boxesâ€”I've worked hands-on to identify risks, strengthen internal controls, and ensure organizations stay ahead of security threats.  

Iâ€™ve worked extensively with frameworks like **ISO 27001, SOX 404, and ITGC audits**, helping organizations build a strong compliance foundation. Whether itâ€™s assessing third-party vendors, managing security risks, or working with auditors, my focus is on making security a business enabler rather than a bottleneck.  

## What I Do  

### ðŸ”¹ Risk Assessment & Compliance  
One of the key aspects of my role is identifying security gaps before they turn into real threats. Iâ€™ve conducted multiple risk assessments, ensuring organizations meet compliance requirements while staying secure.  

For example, during a recent **ITGC audit**, I discovered inconsistencies in user access controls. By working closely with the internal teams, we implemented stronger **role-based access policies** that significantly reduced risk exposure.  

### ðŸ”¹ Security & Governance  
Iâ€™ve worked on implementing risk frameworks aligned with **ISO 27001**, ensuring security isnâ€™t just a one-time effort but an ongoing process.  

In one case, I led an **information security awareness initiative** where we trained employees on phishing and social engineering risks. After the program, we saw a **40% reduction in phishing-related incidents**, proving that security awareness is just as critical as technical controls.  

### ðŸ”¹ Vendor Risk & Business Continuity  
Iâ€™ve evaluated and onboarded multiple third-party vendors, ensuring their security controls align with industry best practices.  

A real challenge I faced was when a **key cloud vendor** didnâ€™t meet our security expectations. Instead of rejecting them outright, I worked with them to enhance their security postureâ€”defining stricter **encryption standards and access controls**. This not only made the vendor compliant but also strengthened our **supply chain security**.  

## How I Approach Challenges  
Risk is always evolvingâ€”**new cyber threats, shifting regulations, and third-party risks** are constant. Instead of reacting to risks after they happen, I take a **proactive approach**, anticipating potential issues and addressing them before they become major problems.  

For instance, when a **regulatory update** affected our third-party risk assessments, I quickly adapted our vendor evaluation process, ensuring compliance without disrupting business operations.  

At the end of the day, **my goal is simple**â€”make security and compliance an **asset to the business, not a roadblock**.
