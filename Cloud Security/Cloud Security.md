## üå•Ô∏è Why Cloud?

- **Scalability:** Cloud providers offer elastic resources that scale on demand.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go pricing avoids upfront infrastructure costs.
- **Agility:** Faster deployment and time-to-market for apps.
- **Resilience:** Built-in redundancy and disaster recovery options.
- **Global Reach:** Access from anywhere with multi-region support.

**Real-Time Example:** A startup hosts their app on AWS to avoid upfront hardware costs, scale globally, and focus on development.

## üõ°Ô∏è Shared Responsibility Model

| Layer                 | Cloud Provider Responsibility                | Customer Responsibility                           |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Physical Security    | Data center access, hardware                  | N/A                                              |
| Infrastructure       | Network, servers, storage                     | Configure securely                               |
| Virtualization Layer | Hypervisor, host OS                           | N/A                                              |
| OS & Applications    | -                                             | Patching, configuring, securing apps             |
| Data & Access        | -                                             | Access control, encryption, monitoring           |

**Example:** In AWS, AWS secures the physical data center, but you are responsible for securing EC2 instances and access to S3.

|-------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Internet Access   | Outbound only (private subnet) | Bi-directional (public subnet) |
| Use Case          | DBs, app servers                | Web servers, public APIs       |
| Direction Control | Egress only                     | Egress + Ingress               |
