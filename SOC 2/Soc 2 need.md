# Why is a SOC Report Needed in Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)?

A **SOC (System and Organization Controls) report** is essential in **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)** because it provides **independent assurance** that a vendor's security, availability, and compliance controls are effective. Organizations rely on SOC reports to evaluate the **trustworthiness and security posture** of their third-party service providers.

## **Key Reasons for SOC Reports in TPRM**

### **Risk Assessment & Compliance**
- SOC reports help assess whether a vendor meets **security and compliance** standards like **ISO 27001, NIST, GDPR, and HIPAA**.
- They highlight any **control deficiencies** that may pose risks to the business.

### **Vendor Due Diligence & Contracting**
- Before onboarding a vendor, organizations review SOC reports to **validate security measures** and ensure compliance with industry standards.
- Many contracts require vendors to provide **annual SOC reports** as part of ongoing due diligence.

### **Financial & Operational Reliability**
- **SOC 1 reports** assess **financial reporting controls**, which is crucial for vendors handling financial transactions or payroll processing.
- **SOC 2 reports** focus on **security, availability, and confidentiality**, helping assess data protection practices.

### **Regulatory & Audit Requirements**
- Many industries (e.g., healthcare, finance) require vendors to provide **SOC reports** to meet regulatory requirements.
- Internal and external auditors use SOC reports for **ITGC audits** and **compliance verification**.

### **Identifying & Managing Vendor Risks**
- SOC reports include **audit findings**, identifying risks that need **mitigation** or **acceptance**.
- If a vendor has **control deficiencies**, organizations can request **remediation plans** before proceeding.

## **Which SOC Report is Needed?**
- **SOC 1** ‚Üí For vendors impacting financial reporting (e.g., payroll providers).
- **SOC 2** ‚Üí For vendors handling **sensitive data, cloud services, or IT operations**.
- **SOC 3** ‚Üí A high-level summary for public consumption (less detailed than SOC 2).

### **Example in TPRM:**
If your company is onboarding a **cloud service provider**, you request a **SOC 2 Type II** report to verify:
- Data encryption measures
- Access controls
- Incident response plans
- Past security incidents & audit exceptions

This ensures the vendor meets your organization's **security and compliance requirements** before contract approval.

# **How to Review a SOC Report in Vendor Risk Assessments**

When evaluating a vendor's **SOC report** as part of **Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)**, you need to focus on key areas that impact security, compliance, and risk exposure.

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the Type of SOC Report**
- **SOC 1** ‚Üí Relevant for vendors handling **financial transactions** (e.g., payroll providers).
- **SOC 2** ‚Üí Evaluates **security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy** controls (critical for cloud service providers, SaaS, and IT vendors).
- **SOC 3** ‚Üí A **public summary** of SOC 2, useful for marketing but lacks detailed control testing.

For most **TPRM assessments, SOC 2 Type II** is preferred because it includes **evidence of control effectiveness over a period (e.g., 6-12 months).**

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Review Key Sections of a SOC 2 Report**

### **üîπ Section 1: Independent Auditor‚Äôs Opinion**
- Determines if the report has a **"clean" (unqualified) opinion** or if there are **exceptions** (deficiencies).
- If there are **"qualified" or "adverse" opinions**, investigate the reasons and assess the impact.

### **üîπ Section 2: Management‚Äôs Assertion**
- Confirms that the vendor **believes their controls are operating effectively**.
- Should align with your expectations and risk tolerance.

### **üîπ Section 3: Description of System & Controls**
- Understand the **vendor's IT environment**, services covered, and control objectives.
- Key focus areas:
  - **Access controls** (MFA, least privilege, role-based access)
  - **Data encryption** (at rest & in transit)
  - **Incident response and breach notification**
  - **Vendor‚Äôs sub-processors (4th parties)**

### **üîπ Section 4: Testing & Auditor Findings (Most Critical Part!)**
- Lists control tests performed, including:
  - **Testing scope** (which systems, applications, and data were reviewed)
  - **Control effectiveness** (Did controls operate as expected?)
  - **Exceptions & deficiencies** (Were there any failed controls?)
- Red flags include:
  - **Recurring issues** (e.g., weak password policies, unresolved security gaps)
  - **High-risk exceptions** (e.g., lack of encryption, weak access controls)
  - **Lack of remediation plans**

### **üîπ Section 5: Other Information (Optional)**
- May include vendor's response to exceptions and planned remediations.

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ Assessing SOC Report Findings & Risks**

| **Finding Type** | **Risk Level** | **Action Required** |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| **No exceptions (Clean Report)** | Low | Approve vendor with periodic monitoring |
| **Minor exceptions (e.g., MFA not enforced on all accounts)** | Medium | Request corrective actions before contract |
| **Major exceptions (e.g., missing encryption for sensitive data)** | High | Require immediate remediation or reconsider vendor |

- **If exceptions are found**, work with the vendor to implement security improvements before **finalizing the contract**.
- If **risks remain unaddressed**, escalate to **senior management for risk acceptance** or look for an alternative vendor.

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ Continuous Monitoring & Follow-ups**
- SOC reports are valid for **one year**, so require **updated SOC 2 reports annually**.
- Implement **ongoing monitoring** (e.g., quarterly security reviews, periodic vendor risk reassessments).
- If the vendor has a **history of control failures**, enforce **stricter SLAs** and monitoring requirements.

## **üìå Final Takeaway**
A **SOC 2 Type II report** is crucial in **vendor risk assessment** because it provides independent validation of a vendor‚Äôs security controls. However, **not all SOC reports are equal**‚Äîyou must **analyze findings, assess risk impact, and ensure corrective actions** before onboarding or continuing vendor relationships.
