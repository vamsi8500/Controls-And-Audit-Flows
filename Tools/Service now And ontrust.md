# ServiceNow â€” Real-Time Usage in TPRM

In real-world TPRM processes, ServiceNow is used to manage the full lifecycle of vendor risk on a single platform.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Workflow:

- When a new vendor is onboarded, we create a vendor record in ServiceNow.
- Automatically send due diligence questionnaires (e.g., cybersecurity, data privacy assessments).
- Based on the responses, ServiceNow calculates a risk score dynamically.
- If the vendor is flagged as high-risk (e.g., weak security controls), ServiceNow automatically triggers a deeper assessment or management review.
- All contracts, risk assessments, audit reports, and remediation actions are tracked centrally.
- Dashboards give leadership real-time visibility into vendor risks, criticality, and open issues.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Value:

- **Scalability**: Easily manage hundreds of vendors without missing any key risk points.
- **Audit readiness**: All documents and workflows are audit-traceable.

> ðŸ’¬ In real projects, I have used ServiceNow VRM to streamline vendor onboarding, automate security review triggers, and track remediation deadlines for critical vendors.

# ðŸš€ OneTrust â€” Real-Time Usage in TPRM

In day-to-day vendor risk management, OneTrust supports automated vendor risk assessments and continuous monitoring.

## ðŸ”¹ Example Workflow:

- Before onboarding a new vendor, I search their risk profile on the OneTrust Third-Party Risk Exchange (saves time vs starting from scratch).
- If needed, I send a customized security questionnaire through OneTrust (e.g., based on SIG Lite or ISO 27001 controls).
- OneTrust automatically flags high-risk vendors based on answers (e.g., missing SOC 2 certification).
- We assign risk mitigation tasks to vendors directly in the tool â€” vendors can submit their corrective action plans inside OneTrust.
- OneTrust integrates with external threat intelligence feeds â€” if a vendor suffers a data breach or cyber incident, I get an alert immediately.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Value:

- **Continuous monitoring** of vendor risks (not just point-in-time assessments).
- **Privacy compliance** is integrated â€” very useful for GDPR, CCPA, and other global data laws.

> ðŸ’¬ I have used OneTrust for streamlining third-party onboarding, real-time breach monitoring, and ensuring vendors signed compliant Data Processing Agreements (DPAs) when handling customer data.
