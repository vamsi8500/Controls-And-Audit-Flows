# ITGC Control Testing ‚Äì Access Provisioning, Management, and De-Provisioning

### üéØ Objective:
Ensure proper control over access provisioning, management, and de-provisioning, guaranteeing that only authorized users can access relevant systems and data.

### ‚úÖ Key Controls in ITGC Access Management

| Control | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| User Access Request Process | Preventive | New users must submit a formal request (e.g., ticket, form). |
| Managerial Approval | Preventive | Access is granted only after supervisor/manager approval. |
| Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) | Preventive | Users are assigned roles with predefined permissions. |
| Segregation of Duties (SoD) | Preventive | Users should not have conflicting roles (e.g., request + approve). |
| Documentation of Access Requests | Detective | Maintain records of who requested, approved, and provisioned access. |
| Regular Access Reviews | Detective | Periodic reviews of user access against current job responsibilities. |
| De-Provisioning of Access | Corrective | Access must be removed timely when users no longer need it (e.g., employee leave). |

### üîç Control Testing Steps

#### 1. User Access Request Process

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Review a sample of access requests | Confirm that access was formally requested |
| Ensure request submission channels are official | Validate tickets/forms are used and tracked |
| Confirm appropriate roles are requested | Ensure users request correct access level |

#### 2. Managerial Approval

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Review access request logs for managerial approval | Ensure approval is obtained before provisioning |
| Verify approval documentation | Confirm manager has signed off on the access |
| Validate approval timelines | Ensure approval occurred within reasonable time frame |

#### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Review role definitions | Ensure each role has appropriate permissions |
| Validate role assignment against job descriptions | Confirm users are given access based on roles |
| Test for least privilege | Ensure users only have necessary permissions |

#### 4. Segregation of Duties (SoD)

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Review roles for conflicting duties | Ensure no one role allows conflicting functions (e.g., request + approve access) |
| Identify users with conflicting roles | Spot users with access that violates SoD policy |
| Verify corrective actions are taken | Ensure conflicts are resolved promptly |

#### 5. Documentation of Access Requests

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Verify documentation of requests | Ensure a complete audit trail exists for all requests |
| Ensure requests are stored for audit purposes | Validate compliance with retention policies |
| Check if all required approvals are documented | Ensure all necessary approvals are recorded |

#### 6. Regular Access Reviews

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Review the frequency of access reviews | Ensure periodic reviews are happening as per policy (e.g., quarterly, annually) |
| Sample reviewed access records | Confirm access reviews were completed for a sample of users |
| Validate findings from reviews | Ensure corrections or removals are done when necessary |

#### 7. De-Provisioning of Access

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Sample de-provisioning records | Check if access is removed when users leave, transfer, or change roles |
| Ensure access is revoked immediately upon termination | Confirm that access is revoked as soon as a user is no longer authorized |
| Verify proper documentation for de-provisioning | Ensure records are kept for future audit and compliance |

### üìù Evidence Collected:
- Access request forms or tickets
- Email/ticket confirming managerial approval
- Access role matrix or RBAC documentation
- SoD analysis or conflict resolution reports
- Regular access review logs
- De-provisioning logs or access termination reports

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Findings:
- Access granted without formal request or approval
- Roles not aligned with job responsibilities (excessive permissions)
- Conflicts in duties (e.g., user can both approve and execute transactions)
- Lack of access reviews or outdated access reviews
- Delayed or incomplete de-provisioning (e.g., accounts not disabled after employee termination)

# ITGC Control Testing ‚Äì Change Management & Incident Management

### üéØ Objective:
Ensure that changes to systems and applications are properly controlled and documented, and that incidents are efficiently managed to minimize risk and restore normal operations.

### ‚úÖ Key Controls in ITGC Change Management

| Control | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| Change Request Process | Preventive | All changes must be formally requested and logged in a change management system. |
| Change Approval | Preventive | Changes must be approved by the designated change authority before implementation. |
| Testing & Validation | Preventive | Changes must be thoroughly tested in a controlled environment before being deployed. |
| Change Implementation & Documentation | Preventive | All changes must be implemented as per the approved plan and properly documented. |
| Post-Change Review | Detective | A post-change review must be conducted to ensure the change was successful and does not negatively affect other systems. |
| Segregation of Duties (SoD) | Preventive | Separate roles should be assigned for requesting, approving, and implementing changes. |

### üîç Control Testing Steps for Change Management

#### 1. Change Request Process

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Review change request logs | Confirm that all changes are logged in the change management system |
| Verify proper documentation for each change | Ensure request details (purpose, scope, and impact) are recorded |
| Check for completeness of requests | Ensure that all necessary information (e.g., impact, testing plan) is provided |

#### 2. Change Approval

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Verify approval by authorized personnel | Ensure changes are approved by the appropriate authority (e.g., change manager) |
| Check approval timelines | Confirm that approvals occur within the required timeframe |
| Review approval documentation | Ensure approvals are properly documented for auditing purposes |

#### 3. Testing & Validation

| Test Step | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Review testing and validation procedures | Ensure that changes are tested in a non-production environment |
| Check test results | Verify that changes pass necessary tests before implementation |
| Validate change impact analysis | Confirm that any impact on existing systems or operations is evaluated |

#### 4. Change Implementation & Documentation
