# Introduction

## Hi, my name is Sai Krishna Vamsi.

I have nearly three years of experience in **Information Security**, focusing on **audit and risk management**.

I worked at **Virtusa as an Information Security Analyst**, where I was responsible for **ISO 27001 compliance, SOX 404 audits, and vendor risk assessments**.

## My Role at Virtusa

At Virtusa, I worked closely with both **internal teams and external auditors** to manage security audits. One of my key responsibilities was handling **ISO 27001 audits**, where I acted as the primary point of contact for external auditors—ensuring that all security controls were in place and properly documented.

I also played a crucial role in **vendor risk management**. This involved assessing **third-party vendors** based on **data classification, security posture, and risk ratings**. I conducted **deep-dive security assessments** covering **access security, cryptography, backup management, and capacity planning**.

## Security Awareness and Training

A big part of my role was also **security awareness and training**. I conducted **organization-wide training sessions** to educate employees on **information security and privacy best practices**. I also led **phishing awareness campaigns using SET tools**, helping employees recognize and respond to security threats.

## Audit and Assessment Coordination

In addition to that, I was involved in **audit and assessment coordination**. I led **Third-Party Security (TPS) reviews and SOX 404 audits**, facilitated **kickoff meetings with stakeholders**, and held **weekly progress discussions** with the **Vendor Relationship Officer (VRO)** to track assessment progress.

## Hands-on Experience in Field Audits

I also have hands-on experience in **field audits and on-site security inspections**. I performed **live over-the-shoulder security reviews**, assessed critical security controls, and conducted **data center security audits** to verify compliance with security policies.

## My Passion for Security

Overall, my experience at Virtusa has given me a strong foundation in **audit management, compliance assurance, and risk assessment**. I'm passionate about making sure security frameworks are **not just implemented—but effectively followed** to protect data and meet regulatory requirements.

I enjoy working in **dynamic environments**, collaborating with teams, and driving security initiatives that strengthen an organization’s security posture.
