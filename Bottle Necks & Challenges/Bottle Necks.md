# Audit Challenges, Issues, and Resolutions

## Challenges Faced During the Audit

### Gathering Evidence from the Auditee (Vendor)
- Vendors often delay providing necessary evidence, making the audit process time-consuming.

### Ensuring Understanding of Control Requirements
- Many vendors struggle to understand the actual control requirements, leading to irrelevant or incomplete evidence submissions.

### Incomplete Evidence Submission
- The evidence provided is often incomplete, inconsistent, or lacks completeness and accuracy (C&A).

### Multiple Follow-Ups for Each Control Domain
- Frequent follow-ups are required to obtain necessary documentation, causing inefficiencies in the audit process.

## Key Issues Identified During the Audit

### 1. Asset Disposal Policy Compliance
- **Issue:** Some servers exceeded their End of Life (EOL) but were still listed in the asset register.
- **Action Taken:** Requested evidence of decommissioning and Certificate of Disposal (COD).
- **Finding:** Assets were still active in the production environment despite claims of removal.

### 2. Removable Media Policy Non-Compliance
- **Issue:** USB ports were claimed to be blocked using JamF, but negative testing showed some devices were not configured.
- **Action Taken:** Requested evidence of JamF configuration settings.
- **Risk Treatment:** Implemented a market-wide tool for blocking USB access, fully configured JamF, and provided evidence.

### 3. Segregation of Duties (SOD) in Change Management
- **Issue:** The same person was approving changes and performing Post-Implementation Reviews (PIR), violating SOD principles.
- **Action Taken:** Implemented SOD controls ensuring different individuals handled:
  - Change Requests
  - Approvals
  - Post-Implementation Reviews

### 4. Backup Management Gaps
- **Issue:** No monitoring process was in place to track backup failures, leaving the backup team unaware of backup statuses.
- **Action Taken:** Implemented automated email notifications (SMTP: backup@tcs.com) to inform the backup team of failures.
- **Risk Treatment:** Created a Distribution List (DL) for weekly InfoSec Manager reviews.

### 5. Capacity Management SLA Violations
- **Issue:** P1 tickets were required to be resolved within 24 hours, but resolution times ranged from 3 to 12 days.
- **Action Taken:** Identified gaps in ticket resolution tracking and enforced stricter SLA monitoring.

### 6. Asset Management Non-Compliance
- **Issue:** The asset inventory lacked a dedicated field to track End of Lifecycle (EOL).
- **Action Taken:** Enforced a mandatory EOL field in the asset inventory system.

### 7. Access Revocation Delays
- **Issue:** Employee access (physical and logical) was not revoked within 24 hours after an employee’s exit, with delays ranging from 3 to 200 days.
- **Action Taken:** Strengthened offboarding with automated workflows for timely access revocation.

## Vendor Manipulation Case

### Scenario:
A vendor claimed their application complied with the latest encryption standards:
- **TLS 1.2 or above** for data in transit
- **RSA 2048-bit or higher** digital signature
- **No weak cipher suites**

### Issue:
- The provided screenshots were irrelevant and did not confirm compliance.

### Verification:
- Conducted an independent security analysis using **SSL Labs**, revealing:
  - System was running on **TLS 1.1** (not 1.2 or above).
  - Weak cipher suites were still enabled.

### Action Taken:
- Reported non-compliance to the **Vendor Risk Office (VRO)** for corrective actions.

## Bottlenecks in External and Internal Audits

### Challenges Faced During Internal Audits

#### Gathering Evidence from the Auditee
- The biggest challenge was obtaining complete and accurate evidence on time.
- Evidence provided was often unclear or lacked **completeness and accuracy (C&A).**

#### Delays in Evidence Collection and Escalation Process
- Process initiated via **Smartsheet** and tracked via **ITSM Tool**.
- **70% of escalations** were due to missing or delayed evidence.

### Escalation Levels for Missing Evidence

#### Level 3: Audit Contact
- If no evidence was provided, escalation was discussed in **weekly status calls**.

#### Level 2: ITSM / Vendor Risk Office (VRO)
- If the due date was approaching, escalation was discussed in **monthly calls**.

#### Level 1: Directors / SMEs / CISO
- If evidence was still missing, final escalation was made to top management.

### Audit Team Involvement
- The IT audit team participated in **weekly and monthly calls** to discuss audit progress.

## Case Study: Transition from On-Premise to Cloud

### Background
- The organization transitioned its **on-premise** infrastructure to the **cloud**, leading to decommissioning of facilities.
- Previously, all production environments were deployed in **CITRIX (IaaS)** servers, networks, OS, and applications.
- In **2023**, the company migrated to **Microsoft Azure Cloud** in the **Europe** region (**PaaS**).

### Risk and Compliance Team’s Responsibilities

#### Offboarding CITRIX and Onboarding Microsoft Azure Cloud
- Ensured a structured decommissioning of **CITRIX resources** before transitioning to **Azure**.

#### Decommissioning CITRIX Assets
- All **CITRIX assets** were identified, documented, and decommissioned.
- **Asset inventory** was updated to reflect decommissioned items.

#### Disposal and Compliance Requirements
- Ensured proper **disposal procedures**, including **Certificate of Disposal (COD) collection**.
- Verified compliance with **industry regulations**.

#### Updating Azure Inventory
- Ensured **Azure asset inventory** was up to date with the latest **server details**.
- Verified **configurations** to meet security and compliance standards.

## Key Takeaways from the Audit Process

1. **Evidence Collection:** A structured escalation matrix ensures timely evidence collection.
2. **Cloud Migration Compliance:** Ensured proper offboarding from **CITRIX** and onboarding to **Azure** with all compliance measures.
3. **Process Improvement:** Regular tracking through **weekly and monthly status calls** helped address delays in evidence collection.
