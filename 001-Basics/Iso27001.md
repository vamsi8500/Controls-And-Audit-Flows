# Difference Between ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 27001:2022

ISO 27001 is the globally recognized standard for Information Security Management Systems (ISMS). The ISO 27001:2022 update introduces key improvements to align with modern cybersecurity risks and evolving technologies.

## ðŸ”¹ Key Differences Between ISO 27001:2013 and ISO 27001:2022

| **Aspect**                | **ISO 27001:2013**                            | **ISO 27001:2022**                              |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Annex A Controls**       | 114 controls in 14 domains                  | 93 controls in 4 domains (merged, removed, and added new controls) |
| **New Controls**           | No specific modern cybersecurity controls   | 11 new controls added (e.g., Threat Intelligence, Cloud Security, Data Masking, Web Filtering) |
| **Control Simplification** | Overlapping and redundant controls         | Merged controls for better clarity and efficiency |
| **Clause Changes**         | No major structure updates                  | Minor wording and structural refinements for clarity |
| **Focus Areas**            | Traditional IT security, compliance-driven  | Modern cybersecurity, risk-based approach, cloud security, and emerging threats |

## ðŸ”¹ New Controls in ISO 27001:2022

ISO 27001:2022 introduces **11 new controls** to address emerging security risks:

1. **Threat Intelligence** â€“ Proactively identifying cyber threats.  
2. **Cloud Security** â€“ Strengthening cloud environments.  
3. **Data Masking** â€“ Protecting sensitive data from exposure.  
4. **Data Leakage Prevention (DLP)** â€“ Preventing unauthorized data transfer.  
5. **Web Filtering** â€“ Blocking malicious websites and harmful content.  
6. **Monitoring Activities** â€“ Continuous security monitoring.  
7. **Secure Coding Practices** â€“ Ensuring secure software development.  
8. **Configuration Management** â€“ Standardizing security configurations.  
9. **Information Deletion** â€“ Secure disposal of sensitive information.  
10. **ICT Readiness for Business Continuity** â€“ Ensuring IT resilience during incidents.  
11. **Physical Security Monitoring** â€“ Surveillance and access control improvements.  

## ðŸ”¹ Why Migrate to ISO 27001:2022?

âœ… **Stronger Cybersecurity Measures** â€“ Aligns with modern threats (e.g., ransomware, cloud risks).  
âœ… **Simplified & Efficient Controls** â€“ Reduces redundancy and overlaps.  
âœ… **Better Risk Management** â€“ Emphasizes a proactive security approach.  
âœ… **Future-Proof Compliance** â€“ Organizations must transition by **October 2025**.
