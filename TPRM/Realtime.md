# Real-Time Vendor Onboarding Process

## ✅ 1. Business Need Identified
Some internal team (like IT, HR, Finance) needs a new service.

They raise a Vendor Request to the Procurement or Vendor Management team.

**Real Example**:  
IT department says:  
"We need to onboard a cloud backup vendor like Veeam or Acronis."

---

## ✅ 2. Vendor Request Form / Intake Form
The requester fills a Vendor Intake Form or creates a ticket.

This form captures basic information:
- Vendor name
- What service they provide
- Type of data they’ll access (sensitive, personal, none)
- Business criticality (high/medium/low)
- Urgency

👉 This is logged in a tool like ServiceNow, SAP Ariba, or even a manual Excel tracker.

---

## ✅ 3. Preliminary Screening (Basic Checks)
Procurement or Risk Management checks:
- Is the vendor legitimate? (basic background check)
- Any red flags? (litigation, financial instability, negative news)

---

## ✅ 4. Send Due Diligence Questionnaire
Risk team sends a Due Diligence Questionnaire to the vendor.  
It usually includes:
- Security posture (ISO 27001, SOC2 reports)
- Financial stability proof (balance sheets)
- Data privacy policies (GDPR compliance)
- Business continuity plans (BCP/DR plans)
- Insurance certificates (liability, cyber insurance)

👉 Vendor must submit completed questionnaire + supporting documents.

---

## ✅ 5. Perform Risk Assessment
TPRM Analyst or GRC team analyzes the responses.  
They rate the risk:
- Low Risk: Light touch (basic checks)
- Medium Risk: Moderate review
- High Risk: Deep dive (maybe even vendor site audit)

👉 **Real-time**: If a vendor handles sensitive data, they get extra scrutiny.

---

## ✅ 6. Internal Approvals
Based on risk score, the risk team recommends:
- Proceed (Approved)
- Proceed with mitigation plans (Conditional approval)
- Reject (High-risk vendor, unsafe)

**Approval matrix:**
- Procurement Head ✅
- Security Team Head ✅
- Business Unit Head ✅

---

## ✅ 7. Negotiate and Sign Contract
Procurement drafts or modifies a contract.  
Contract must include:
- Data Protection Addendum (DPA) (for GDPR)
- Service Level Agreements (SLAs) (e.g., uptime guarantees)
- Audit rights (company can audit vendor if needed)
- Termination clauses (for breaches)

👉 Legal Team reviews and finalizes the contract.

---

## ✅ 8. Vendor Profile Creation
Once the contract is signed:
- Vendor is created in internal systems (ERP, SAP, Oracle).
- Banking information, contact information entered.
- Vendor is now authorized to provide services.

---

## ✅ 9. Kickoff Meeting / Handover
Schedule a Kickoff call with Vendor + Business + IT/Security Teams.  
Set clear expectations:
- Reporting structure
- Escalation matrix
- Communication plan

---

## ✅ 10. Ongoing Monitoring Setup
Start monitoring vendor performance:
- Quarterly reviews
- Annual reassessments
- Incident reporting obligations
- Performance scorecards

👉 For high-risk vendors, you might ask for yearly updated SOC reports or security posture confirmations.

---

## 🛠️ Real-Time Mini Example:
Your company needs a video conferencing solution.  
You shortlist "VendorX."  
- VendorX fills a security questionnaire + shares ISO 27001 cert.  
- You identify it's Medium Risk (moderate data involved).  
- After approvals, you sign a contract with DPA terms.  
- VendorX is added to SAP.  
- You launch services and monitor their SLA quarterly.

---

## ⚡ Quick Tip:
**Speed vs Risk is always a tension.**  
Business units want the vendor onboarded fast.  
Risk teams want the vendor assessed properly.  
Balancing both is key to success in real-time onboarding! 🎯
