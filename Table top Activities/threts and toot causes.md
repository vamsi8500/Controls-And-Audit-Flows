# Tabletop Activities in Cybersecurity & Risk Management

Tabletop activities are simulated, discussion-based exercises conducted to test an organization's response to security incidents, disasters, or compliance scenarios. These exercises help teams identify gaps, improve coordination, and refine their incident response plans without disrupting operations.

## Key Aspects of Tabletop Exercises

### 1. Purpose
- Validate incident response and business continuity plans.
- Improve coordination between teams (IT, Security, Compliance, Legal, etc.).
- Identify gaps and areas for improvement before a real incident occurs.
- Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., SOX, NIST, ISO 27001).

### 2. Format
- **Discussion-based:** No real-time execution, just scenario-based decision-making.
- **Participants:** Incident Response Team, IT, Compliance, Legal, Senior Management.
- **Facilitator:** Guides the session and presents different threat scenarios.

### Scenario Examples
- **Cyber Attack:** Ransomware outbreak affecting financial systems.
- **Data Breach:** Employee credentials leaked, leading to unauthorized access.
- **Disaster Recovery:** Data center failure affecting critical applications.
- **Regulatory Compliance Issue:** SOX or GDPR violation in a recent audit.

## Types of Tabletop Exercises

### 1. Disaster Recovery Tabletop Exercise
âœ… **Focus:** Evaluates an organizationâ€™s ability to restore operations after a major disruption.
âœ… **Example Scenario:** A server crash leads to loss of financial transaction records.
âœ… **Key Questions:**
- How quickly can data be restored?
- What backup solutions are in place?
- Who needs to be informed?

### 2. Incident Response Tabletop Exercise
âœ… **Focus:** Tests an organizationâ€™s ability to detect, respond, and recover from a cybersecurity attack.
âœ… **Example Scenario:** A phishing email compromised an employeeâ€™s credentials, leading to unauthorized access.
âœ… **Key Questions:**
- How was the attack detected?
- What steps should the Security team take first?
- How should internal & external stakeholders be notified?

## Real-Time Implementation of Tabletop Exercises

### 1. Planning the Exercise
ðŸ“Œ **Step 1:** Define objectives (e.g., test ransomware response).
ðŸ“Œ **Step 2:** Identify participants (IT, Security, Compliance, Management).
ðŸ“Œ **Step 3:** Select scenarios (e.g., system outage, breach, fraud attempt).
ðŸ“Œ **Step 4:** Develop a script with incident progression steps.

### 2. Conducting the Exercise
ðŸ“Œ **Step 5:** Gather participants i
